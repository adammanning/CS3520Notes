Red-Black Trees
  Every node is either red or black

  Maintain these constraints for balancing the tree
  1. No red node has a red child
  2. Every path from the root to an empty node contains the same number of black nodes

  These constraints ensure the longest possible path is no more than twice as long as the shortest path
